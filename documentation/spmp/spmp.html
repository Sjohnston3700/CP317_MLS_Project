    <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This Software Project Management Plan (SPMP) for ezMarker outlines the goals and deliverables. ezMarker will allow Wilfrid Laurier’s markers and instructors to upload a large quantity of feedback for students to the MyLearningSpace (MLS) site quickly and efficiently. Previously, there was no other way to provide feedback for students without individually entering it through the current MLS interface, and this can be time consuming. The front-end for this application will use HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript/JQuery. The back-end for ezMarker will be written in Python and will make use of the Brightspace API that powers MLS.
    </p>

    <h3 id="purpose">1.1 Purpose, Scope, and Objectives</h3>
    <p>This document outlines ezMarker and its features and deliverables.</p>
    <p>
        The main project objective is to implement a fully functioning program to be used across the Wilfrid Laurier University MLS website (and possibly others using Brightspace) before December 2017. It will primarily be used by University markers and instructors.
    </p>

    <p>The client for this project is David Brown. The team leader will communicate with said client via email or meetings and relay information to the rest of the team. </p>
    <p>Another external entity will be the MLS website and its affiliates. The team leader will be communicating with affiliates via email.</p>

    <img src="/static/img/map.png" alt="Internal Structure Map" style="width:888px;height:443px;">
    <p>
        The internal structure of the team is based around four distinct divisions. Each division of the project team assigns a leader that will be representing said division. They are expected to attend regular meetings with other leaders to discuss progress in their division. The project leader represents the entire team and will be communicating with all external entities.
    </p>
    <p>Each division will be expected to organize regular meetings that all members of the division will attend.</p>
    <p>Communication with all members of the team and/or division will be done using Slack as the primary tool.</p>
    <p>Decisions will be made democratically where members will vote. Leaders' votes are worth the same as regular members.</p>

    <h3 id="control-plan">5.3 Control Plan</h3>

    <h4 id="reqs-control-plan">5.3.1 Requirements Control Plan</h4>
    <p>All requirement changes will require a team discussion to evaluate the change in relation to project guidelines, scope, and quality.</p>
    <p>
        Two main techniques include:
        <ul>
            <li>Traceability - Any change in the project can be directly traced back to the requirements plan</li>
            <li>Impact Analysis -  Team will discuss impact of change</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4 id="schedule-control-plan">5.3.2 Schedule Control Plan</h4>
    <p>
        Each member of the team will make their own individual efforts to consult the project schedule and meet deadlines. Upon missing a deadline, the schedule will be updated accordingly through discussion among team members.
    </p>
    <p>Each team member will be expected to record time spent working on each part of the project and evaluate whether they will meet the deadline that is set on the schedule.</p>

    <h4 id="quality-control-plan">5.3.3 Quality Control Plan</h4>
    <p>
        Each member of the team is expected to produce work that is correct and maintains the team’s standards of quality. To ensure this, the Testing team will be regularly testing code to be working as intended and take action if it does not meet team standards. They will be expected to notify the team that produced the fault so that it can be corrected as quickly as possible.
    </p>

    <h4 id="reporting-plan">5.3.4 Reporting Plan</h4>
    <p>There are 4 main reporting mechanisms that will be used by the project team.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Regular meetings: The team will regularly get together and reporting may be done verbally among group members</li>
            <li>Slack: Reports can be done through the team’s main communication tool</li>
            <li>Asana: Tickets can be made in Asana that will notify members that a report has been made and the details of said report</li>
            <li>QA Spreadsheet: Issues can be logged in a Google Spreadsheet. The reporter must then notify the appropriate parties via Slack</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4 id="metrics-plan">5.3.5 Metrics Collection Plan</h4>
    <p>The website ezEmployee will be used to collect project metrics. Project members will be expected to log their time spent working through the website to be easily validated, analyzed, and reported.</p>

    <h3 id="risk-management-plan">5.4 Risk Management Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Risk factors that the project will face includes work that does not meet the deadline due to class conflicts, external responsibilities, unforeseen circumstances. Conflicts will be constantly tracked and if a conflict is met, action will be taken including an attempt to have another team member take over to meet the deadline.
    </p>
    <p>Integration between front-end and back-end may not work as expected and will be met with a meeting between all members of both teams to discuss the necessary steps to take.</p>
    <p>Team members may be met with software malfunction and will be accommodated with working software.</p>
    <p>Code may break at any point and therefore will be reverted to the last working commit to not lose time debugging.</p>

        Roles and tasks may be shifted to accommodate the student calendar and any unforeseen events. Team members will self document and self report their progress and issues they may encounter during development. There will be weekly meetings with group leaders to summarize the position of their respective sections. Any task not completed during the assigned time will be shifted to the next phase and may result in a reallocation of team resources.
    </p>

    <h3 id="methods">6.2 Methods, Tools and Techniques</h3>
    <p>
        The project is split up into two sections: front-end and back-end. They will be worked on by separate teams and stored in a Github repository. The leader of each section will work out internally the preferred strategy and framework.

    </p>

    <h3 id="audit-plan">7.4 Reviews and Audit Plan</h3>
    <p>
        The team will be distributed prototypes that will be unit tested prior to client presentation. The team will also peer review code within their sections and resolve any immediate bugs, along with proper documentation. All features will be presented to the client for acceptance testing before finalization.
    </p>

    <h3 id="resolution-plan">7.5 Problem Resolution Plan</h3>
    <p>
        In the event of arising issues, the team will follow the general contingency plan listed below:
