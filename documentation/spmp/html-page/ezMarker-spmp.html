        <h2 id="overview">1.0 Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Software Project Management Plan (SPMP) for ezMarker outlines the goals and deliverables. ezMarker will allow Wilfrid Laurier’s markers and instructors to upload a large quantity amount of feedback for individual students to the MLS site quickly and efficiently. Previously, there was no other way to provide feedback for students without individually entering feedback which is extremely time consuming. ezMarker will be written in the Python language and uses the Desire to Learn API called Bright Space. The Bright Space API is versatile as it houses support for many different languages and has the same functions as a web browser which is extremely important for students, as submission and viewing of assignment feedback is done through the web browser.
        </p>

        <p>All organizational aspects of the projects are recorded here. Internal and external entities and how they will collaborate with one another will be defined here.</p>
		
		<h3 id="external-structure">4.1 External Structure</h3>
        <p>The client for this project is David Brown. The team leader will communicate with said client via email or meeting and relay information to the rest of the team. </p>
		<p>Another external entity will be the MLS website and its affiliates. The team leader will be communicating with affiliates via email.</p>
    
		<h3 id="internal-structure">4.2 Internal Structure</h3>
		<img src="resources\map.png" alt="Internal Structure Map" style="width:888px;height:443px;">
		<p>
			The internal structure of the team is based around 4 distinct divisions. Each division of the project team assigns a leader that will be representing said division. They are expected to attend regular meetings with other leaders to discuss progress in their division. The project leader represents the entire team and will be communicating with all external entities.
		</p>
		<p>Each division will be expected to organize regular meetings that all members of the division will attend.</p>
		<p>Communication with all members of the team and/or division will be done using Slack as the primary tool.</p>
		<p>Decisions will be made democratically where members will vote. Leaders' votes are worth the same as regular members.</p>

			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h4 id="metrics-plan">5.3.5 Metrics Collection Plan</h4>

		<h3 id="risk-management-plan">5.4 Risk Management Plan</h3>
        <p>
			Risk factors that the project will face includes work that does not meet the deadline due to class conflicts, external responsibilities, unforeseen circumstances. This will be constantly tracked and if a conflict is met, action will be taken including an attempt to have another team member take over to meet the deadline.
		</p>
		<p>Integration between front end and back end may not work as expected and will be met with a meeting between all members of both teams to discuss the necessary steps to take.</p>
		<p>Team members may be met with software malfunction and will be accommodated with working software.</p>
		<p>Code may break at any point and therefore will be reverted to the last working commit to not lose time debugging.</p>

			Roles and tasks may be shifted to accommodate the student calendar and any unforeseen events. Team members will self document and self report their progress and issues they may encounter during development. There will be weekly meeting with group leaders to summarize the position of respective sections. Any task not completed during assigned time will be either shifted to the next phase or teams will be rebalanced for as per discussion of each case.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="methods">6.2 Methods, Tools and Techniques</h3>
        <p>
			The project is split up into two sections: front end and back end. They will be worked on within separate teams and stored in a Github repository. The leader of each section will internally work out the preferred strategy and framework.
		</p>
		<p>Front end (detailed description to be added as design phase approaches)
			<ul>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>HTML/CSS</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

Additional resources may include but not limited to printers, drafting materials, and other University resources.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="product-acceptance-plan">6.4 Product Acceptance Plan</h3>
