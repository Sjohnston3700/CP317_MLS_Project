This semester, the CP317 class was tasked with working with over 20 other poeple to complete a software engineering project over
the course of 3 months. Our group, ezMarker, completed the task through the frustration and hard work that came with such an assignment.
Many challanges were faced as we learned to work with so many other people. Each person was assigned to a section of the project that
highlighted their skills and qualities. The writers were assigned to documentation, the good coders were assigned to back or front end,
and the thorough analysts were assigned to testing. The qualities of each person shone through their work in each section. The writers 
wrote, the coders coded, and the testers tested to the best of their ability and it really showed. The front and back end team were tasked
with actually implementing the project discussed. Through the challenges and frustration that came with coding such a big project with
so many others, they delivered a product that is sure to make david brown's jaw drop. The final product was so vigorous and thoroughly
tested that an error is not be found. The whole process to get where we are is well documented in all the documentation associated with 
the project. As explained, all the teams learned how to work with each other collaborated well to create a polished final product that will hopefully give us the A that we are all striving to get.
