    <h2 id="1. Introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>ezMarker is a web application that allows instructors to upload grades and feedback onto MyLearningSpace with ease. <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Autograder</a> (<a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a>) is Wilfrid Laurier University's online learning management system. It is a rebranded version of <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Autograder</a>, created by <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Autograder</a> (<a href="#1.3%20Definitions">D2L</a>). This educational platform allows students and instructors to communicate, share resources, and keep track of academic progress. A vital part of this system is a feature that allows instructors to set grades and give feedback on student work. The current feedback system on <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a> becomes tedious and is time consuming when giving feedback for large classes, since feedback must be manually set for each student. ezMarker makes it faster to grade students by allowing bulk grade and feedback uploading with the use of the <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Brightspace API</a>.</p>
    <p>A driving force behind reworking the feedback feature is the <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Autograder</a> program, currently used by the computer science department at Wilfrid Laurier University. This program generates the files that ezMarker uploads.</p>
    <p>ezMarker builds on and extends an existing project developed by Harold Hodgins for the upload of grades and feedback on <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="1.1 Purpose">Purpose</h3>
    <p>This document lists the requirements of the ezMarker project, and has been created for developers as a basis for their work and to help the client understand the functionality of the software.</p>
    <p>The remainder of this document explains the details of interfaces, software platforms used, product design, and functionality. The document follows the IEEE Software Requirements Specifications document standards.</p>
    <h3 id="1.2 Scope">Scope</h3>
    <p>ezMarker is a website that adds extended functionality to the <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a> platform by providing an interface for setting student grades and feedback that is superior to the current <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a> implementation. In the existing system feedback has to be set individually for each student. For courses with many students, inputting feedback for each student can take hours. ezMarker provides an alternate user interface that reduces grade recording time to minutes by allowing users to upload a single file that contains both grades and feedback for any students the user wishes to mark.</p>
    <p>After logging into ezMarker, the marker selects a course and a grade item (ex. Midterm 1). The marker then uploads a file with the grades and feedback they want submitted to that grade item. ezMarker parses the file and uses the <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Brightspace API</a> to set the grades and feedback in <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a>. Following this, the marker is brought to a report page where they can see the results of the upload. Finally, they are given the option to do another upload or to logout.</p>
    <p>ezMarker also offers users the ability to change the maximum grade value and manually input grades and feedback for selected students, such that ezMarker can replace the current <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a> website for all marking purposes.</p>
    <p>There are both PHP and Python versions of ezMarker.</p>

    <p>The current <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MLS</a> interface for uploading grades: </p>
