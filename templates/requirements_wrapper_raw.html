<p>
	 ezMarker is a web application that allows instructors to upload grades into MyLearningSpace with ease. <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">MyLearningSpace</a> (MLS) is Laurier's online learning management system. It is a rebranded version of a product called <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Brightspace</a>, created by <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Desire2Learn</a> (D2L). This educational platform allows students and instructors to communicate, share resources, and keep track of student progress. A vital part of this system is the feature that allows instructors to set grades and give feedback on student work. The current feedback system on MLS is tedious and becomes very time consuming when giving feedback for large classes, as users must set feedback individually for each student. ezMarker will cut down on this time by allowing bulk grade and feedback upload.
</p>
<h3 id="1.1 Purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>
	This document lists the requirements of the ezMarker project, and has been created for developers as a basis for their work and to help the client understand the functionality of the software.
</p>
<h3 id="1.2 Scope">1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>
	ezMarker is a website that adds extended functionality to the MLS platform by providing an interface for setting student grades and feedback that is superior to the current MLS implementation. In the existing system feedback has to be set individually for each student. For courses with many students, inputting feedback for each student can take hours. ezMarker provides an alternate user interface that reduces grade recording time to minutes by allowing users to upload a single file that contains both grades and feedback for any students the user wishes to mark.</p> 
<p>
	After logging into ezMarker, the marker selects a course and a grade item (ex. Midterm 1). The marker then uploads a file with the grades and feedback they want submitted to that grade item. ezMarker parses the file and uses the <a href="http://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/reference.html">Brightspace API</a> to set the grades and feedback in MLS. Following this, the marker is brought to a report page where they can see the results of the upload. Finally, they are given the option to do another upload or to logout.
</p>
<p>ezMarker also offers the capability to manually input grades and feedback for selected students, such that ezMarker can replace the current MLS website for all marking purposes.</p>

<h3 id="2.1 Product Perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
<p>
	ezMarker is a web-based application that allows users to set student grades and feedback in MLS through the use of the Brightspace API. Users are able to set grades and feedback by uploading files produced by the <a href="#1.3%20Definitions">Autograder</a> or by manually inputting information into a webpage. There will be no consideration for mobile usability.
</p>
<h3 id="2.2 Product Functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Upload an Autograder file to set grades and feedback in MLS for all students in a course.</li>
    <li>Manually input grades and feedback to be set in MLS for selected students in a course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.5 Constraints">2.5 Constraints</h3>
<p>Development is constrained by the capabilities of the Brightspace API and the development skills of the team.</p>
<h3 id="2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies">2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>ezMarker is dependent on continued support for the Brightspace API and the Autograder.</p>
