    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        ezMarker is a web application that allows instructors to upload grades into MyLearningSpace with ease. MyLearningSpace (MLS) is Laurier's online learning management system. It is a rebranded version of a product called Brightspace, created by Desire2Learn (D2L).  ezMarker uses the Brightspace API to add assignment marks and feedback from the auto-grader to MyLearningSpace for each student in bulk.  ezMarker cuts down TA/IA workloads significantly, as a process that took several hours now takes less than 10 minutes using the software.  This document gives a brief outline of the structure of the softwareâ€™s classes, objects, and the interactions between them.
