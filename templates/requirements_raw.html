<h3>Use Case Diagram:</h3>
<img id="use-case-diagram" src="/static/img/use_case_diagram.png">
<h2 id="1. Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>Wilfrid Laurier University uses an online learning management system called MyLearningSpace (MLS), which is a rebranded version of a product called BrightSpace, created by Desire2Learn (D2L). This educational platform allows students and instructors to communicate, share resources, and keep track of student progress. A vital part of this system is the feature that allows instructors to give feedback on student work. Currently the feedback system on MLS is very tedious and time consuming especially when creating individual feedback for large class sizes. The aim of this project is to make the feedback interface on MLS more user friendly and efficient.</p>
<h3 id="1.1 Purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
	<p>This document summarizes the goals and requirements of the ezGrader project. This includes the functions implemented, platforms used and etc. This document is created for developers as a basis for their work and for users looking to understand the functionality of this software.</p>
<h3 id="1.2 Scope">1.2 Scope</h3>
	<p>ezMarker is a web platform that adds extended functionality to the MLS platform by setting student grades and feedback using the BrightSpace API. The new functionality will leave behind the conventional feedback uploading techniques such as manual entry or through a Dropbox interface. The user will start by selecting the course and grade item, then upload a formatted text file. This text file will be parsed by the ezMarker backend and upload the students&rsquo; grades and feedback through the Brightspace API. The goal of implementing a new system of feedback and grading is to add improve the efficiency of uploading student grades and feedback. With this software, professors and T.As/I.As will no longer have to enter marks and feedback one-by-one, making the process integrated and complete.</p>

<h2 id="2. Overall Description">2. Overall Description</h2>
<h3 id="2.1 Product Perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
	<p>ezMarker is a web-based application that allows users to set students&rsquo; grades in MLS through the use of the Brightspace API. Users will be able to set grades by uploading files from the Autograder or by manually inputting information into a webpage.</p>
<h4>2.1.1 User Interfaces</h4>
<ol>
	<li>MLS Login Page</li>
		<ul>
			<li>User will sign into MLS to provide authentication for use of the Brightspace API</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Course List Page
		<ul>
			<li>Shows all courses from current term that user has permission to set grades for</li>
			<li>Selecting a course will hide/show the grade items</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Grade Item Page
		<ul>
			<li>User can upload an Autograder file (students to be graded will be determined by file)</li>
			<li>User can also search for students and manually input grades and feedback through a web form</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Report Page
		<ul>
			<li>Displays outcome of set grades and feedback operation</li>
			<li>Options to return to Course List Page or Logout</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2.2 Product Functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Upload Autograder file to set grades and feedback in MLS for all students in a course</li>
	<li>Manually input grades and feedback to be set in MLS for selected students in a course</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2.3 User Characteristics">2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
	<p>Users will be MLS users with permissions to set grades for students (i.e. professors and TAs). No technical experience is required for the use of ezMarker.</p>
<h3 id="2.4 Constraints">2.4 Constraints</h3>
	<p>Development will be constrained by the capabilities of the Brightspace API.</p>
<h3 id="2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
	<p>ezMarker is dependent on continued support for Brightspace API and the Autograder outputting correct files.</p>
<h2 id="3. Software Requirements">3. Software Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="3.1 User Interfaces">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
	<p>3.1.1 The user signs into the website using their MLS login credentials</p>
	<p>3.1.2 Once logged in, the user will be presented with a list of courses from the current term that the user has permission to set grades for. Courses should be sorted by course number.</p>
	<p>3.1.3 Selecting a course will expand/collapse the course&rsquo;s grade items</p>
	<p>3.1.4 The Grade Item page will be opened once a grade item is selected.</p>
	<p>3.1.4.1 A Choose File button will open file dialog for selecting an Autograder file.</p>
	<p>3.1.4.2 An Upload Grades File button will upload the file and set the grades.</p>
	<p>3.1.4.3 A search bar will appear below the above 2 buttons choosing students to manual input data for.</p>
	<p>3.1.4.4 Selecting a student returned by the search bar will add Grade and Feedback input boxes (with the student&rsquo;s name and ID acting as a label above them) to the page (underneath any existing students). An X icon next to the student&rsquo;s ID will remove the input boxes from the page.</p>
	<p>3.1.4.5 There will be a Select All button next to the search bar for quickly adding input boxes for all students.</p>
	<p>3.1.4.6 A Set Grades button will use the manually inputted grades and feedback to set the grades.</p>

<h3 id="3.2 Functional Requirements">3.2 Functional Requirements</h3>
<p>3.2.1 Login. Occurs when users click the Login button on the Login page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the Brightspace API cannot identify the user, they will not be able to login and use the service. Similarly, if the user is identified but does not have permission to edit grades of any courses (determined by the Brightspace API), they will not be able to login and use the service.</li>
	<li>Else, the user is brought to the Course List page</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2.2 Upload/parse file. Occurs once Upload has been clicked and the user has selected a file in the file dialog.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the file is not a correctly formatted Autograder file, an error message is displayed and the file is not parsed.</li>
	<li>If a necessary parameter for a grade is missing, that grade will not be accepted.</li>
	<li>Only grades for which the total grade is greater than or equal to the grade received will be accepted (i.e. 45/23 is not a valid grade). If the grade total is smaller than the grade received, the user will be prompted to continue (and skip the student) or modify the total of the grade item (taken to corresponding MLS page).</li>
	<li>Grades will only be accepted for students that are currently enrolled in the selected course.</li>
	<li>The results of the parsing will be relayed to the user on the Report page.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2.3 Search students. Occurs when user types into search bar on Grade Item page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The search will be dynamic and will search students by name until a numeric character is entered, at which point student IDs are searched.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2.4 Get manually input data. Occurs when user has clicked Set Grades.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The data that has been input for the selected student(s) will be stored.</li>
	<li>Only grades for which the total grade is greater than or equal to the grade received will be accepted (i.e. 45/23 is not a valid grade).</li>
	<li>If no grade value has been entered for a student, the user will be prompted to choose if they want to go back and set a grade value or continue. If they continue, no grade will be set for the student.</li>
	<li>Any unaccepted grades will be relayed to the user on the Report page.</li>
</ul>
	<p>3.2.5 Set grade and feedback data. Occurs once manually inputted data has been submitted or a formatted file has been uploaded.</p>
