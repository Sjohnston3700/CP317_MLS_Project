From Harold's email: 

To make it work you will need to update the api key, api id, and lms values in the conf_basic_template.py file and rename it as conf_basic.py
api key = BpBbSId5iAVG988lMvgj5g
api id = rzQ2Fl48OyGpabNiVo5wYQ
lms = wlutest.desire2learn.com

9. Name the file to conf_basic.py
10. Start the app by using 'python app.py' 
11. You should see that it is running on localhost:8080/
12. If you did the conf_basic.py file correctly, you should be brought to the MLS login page
