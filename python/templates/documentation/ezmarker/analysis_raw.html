<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	ezMarker is a web application that allows instructors at Wilfrid Laurier University to bulk upload grades and feedback into MyLearningSpace,with the integration of the Brightspace API supported by D2L. The goal of ezMarker is to solve the issues regarding inefficient manual grade uploading and and feedback through the current MyLearningSpace interface. On average, it can take markers a few hours to physically upload grades for one class. Marking time is cut down to minutes with the use of ezMarker's bulk file uploading features. This document outlines the structure of the classes and objects for the ezMarker application, including the software interaction summary.
